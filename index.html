    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>As a recent graduate of Computer Science with a
            focus on mobile application and web development, I
            have gained hands on experience in developing
            various projects such as a landmark navigation
            application using Java, REST APIs, and Firebase,
            and a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            Through these projects, I have demonstrated my
            ability to think creatively and problem solve in a fast
            paced environment. I am eager to bring these skills
            and my passion for software development to a
            dynamic team where I can continue to grow and
            contribute to the success of the organization.</p>
